FlickrCleanr 0.1.3
==================

Yahoo! decided to ruin the fine design job they did on Flickr with a horrible purple bar at the top of the screen. This extension fixes that.

This is as simple as it gets right now. There will certainly be adjustments in the near future.


## Changelog

* 0.1 - Initial version.
* 0.1.1 - Added additional icon sizes.
* 0.1.2 - Fixed manifest.json.
* 0.1.3 - Minor tweaks.


## The `/design` folder

I used [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/) to create all images because Photoshop is too damn expensive. Deal with it.
